The chatbot assists users in planning their trips by presenting various information such as tourist attractions, hotels, beaches, restaurants in different cities.

The aim of the project :

a) Providing Touristic Information: To enable users to get information about the cities they want to travel to. For example, providing information about places to visit, beaches, restaurants, and accommodation options in the city.

b) Providing Information About Hotels: To enable users to search for hotels according to the features they want, to access more detailed information about the hotels in the specified option and to choose the hotel that best suits their preferences.

  In this project, the power of Python was combined with the language model of OpenAI, and the project was made user-friendly and scalable with the Flask REST API structure. The JSON file, which can use an example, was also given.
